Filter a RSS feed with keywords

I use this to filter uninteresting articles from the local news paper on my MagicMirror, change the url in `$rss` to your RSS feed url and edit the keywords in `$filterarray` to what you want to skip.
This will only filter from the title but can of course be changed.
