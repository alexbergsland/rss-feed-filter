# rss-feed-filter
Filter a RSS feed with keywords

This script will take a RSS feed, filter it by keywords and present it as a RSS feed.

I use this to filter uninteresting articles from the local news paper on my MagicMirror, change the url in `$rss` to your RSS feed url and edit the keywords in `$filterarray` to what you want to skip.
This will only filter from the title but can of course be changed.
